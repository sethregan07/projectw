# Privacy-Focused Blockchain Microservices Architecture

## Design Philosophy
Inspired by Edward Snowden's principles of digital privacy and decentralization, this architecture prioritizes:
- Minimal data exposure
- End-to-end encryption
- Decentralized identity
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Anonymity-preserving transactions

## Core Components

### 1. Decentralized Identity Service
- Self-sovereign identity management
- Zero-knowledge claim verification
- Ephemeral key generation
- Peer authentication without central authority

### 2. Encrypted Communication Layer
- End-to-end encryption using X25519 and AES-GCM
- Ephemeral key exchange
- Secure message routing
- No persistent message storage

### 3. Blockchain Node
- Minimal, privacy-preserving transaction model
- Zero-knowledge proof for transaction validation
- Distributed consensus mechanism
- No centralized transaction tracking

### 4. Disaster Recovery
- Encrypted, distributed backup mechanism
- VPS cloning script
- No centralized backup storage

## Security Principles

### Anonymity
- No persistent user identifiers
- Ephemeral keys for each transaction
- Randomized routing

### Data Minimization
- Only essential metadata stored
- Automatic data expiration
- No long-term transaction history

### Encryption
- Mandatory end-to-end encryption
- Quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives
- Regular key rotation

## Threat Model

### Potential Adversaries
- State-level surveillance
- Corporate data mining
- Malicious network actors

### Mitigation Strategies
- Onion routing
- Decentralized network topology
- No single point of failure
- Automatic peer verification

## Technical Implementation

### Cryptographic Primitives
- Signing: Ed25519
- Key Exchange: X25519
- Encryption: AES-256-GCM
- Hashing: SHA3-256
- Zero-Knowledge: zk-SNARK

### Network Characteristics
- Peer-to-peer
- No centralized coordination
- Dynamic node discovery
- Automatic peer reputation system

## Operational Guidelines

### Node Operation
- Minimal resource consumption
- Optional full/light node modes
- Automatic security updates
- No mandatory data retention

### Privacy Guarantees
- Transaction unlinkability
- Sender/recipient anonymity
- No transaction metadata persistence
- Automatic key and identity rotation

## Future Roadmap
- Quantum-resistant cryptography
- Improved zero-knowledge proof systems
- Decentralized governance mechanisms
- Enhanced anonymity networks

## Compliance
- GDPR data protection principles
- Privacy by design
- Minimal personal data processing
